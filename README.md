Here are my solutions to the exercises from the "Programming Techniques" course, taken during the second semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens.

Any missing solutions will be added soon!

Although some solutions might not be optimized for complexity, they successfully pass all test cases on Grader.

I welcome any corrections for mistakes or suggestions for optimizations to improve these files!
