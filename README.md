My solutions to the exercises for the course "Programming Techniques" of the 2nd semester of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens.

Missing solutions will be added son enough!

Some of them may not be ideal in terms of complexity, but for sure they pass all the test cases on Grader.

Any correction to mistakes i may have made while writing these files as well as any optimization, will be appreciated!
